Building Open Chernobyl
=======================

Quick Instructions
------------------
 * Do a recursive checkout of this repository (https://github.com/openchernobyl/openchernobyl.git)
 * Compile ocMain.cpp (the game is compiled as a single translation unit)
 
If you want to do serious development on Open Chernobyl you will need to set up your build environment to run
to run build/oc_build/bin/oc_build.bat as a pre-build step (make sure it is run from the build/oc_build/bin
directory). The pre-build step does code generation.
