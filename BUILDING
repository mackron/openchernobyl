Dependencies
============
The source code of every dependency is included in the repository, but you will need to compile them
before you'll be able to link. You will not need to configure include paths, but you will need to 
configure library paths.

Dependencies can be found in the source/external folder.


Building Open Chernobyl
=======================

Quick Instructions
------------------
 * Do a recursive checkout of this repository (https://github.com/openchernobyl/openchernobyl.git)
 * Compile Bullet (source/external/bullet3)
 * (Optional) Set up your build environment to run build/oc_build/bin/oc_build.bat as a pre-build step (make
   sure it is run from the build/oc_build/bin directory)
   * This is optional, but if you want to do serious development you will need to do this
 * Compile ocMain.cpp (the game is compiled as a single translation unit) and link to the necessary
   third-party libraries:
   * BulletDynamics_Debug.lib
   * BulletCollision_Debug.lib
   * LinearMath_Debug.lib
