Dependencies
============
The source code of every dependency is included in the repository, but you will need to compile them
before you'll be able to link. You will not need to configure include paths, but you will need to 
configure library paths.

Dependencies can be found in the source/external folder.


Building Open Chernobyl Itself
==============================
Once you've compiled the dependencies it should be fairly easy to compile the game. If you are not
intending on doing any serious development you can simply compile ocMain.cpp.

If you are wanting to do more serious development you will first need to build the Open Chernobyl
build tool. The code for this is found in source/oc_build and can be compiled by simply compiling
the ocbMain.cpp file. The build tool is a simple command-line interface and you simply run it as
a pre-build step.


The Open Chernobyl Build Tool
=============================
Serious work on Open Chernobyl depends on the build tool mentioned above. The main responsibility
for this tool is code generation and certain compile-time optimizations. An example might be shader
compilation: shaders can be written in GLSL and then compiled into Spir-V at compile time to avoid
run-time overhead.
