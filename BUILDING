Dependencies
============
The source code of every dependency is included in the repository, but you will need to compile them
before you'll be able to link. You will not need to configure include paths, but you will need to 
configure library paths.

Dependencies can be found in the source/external folder.


Building Open Chernobyl Itself
==============================
Once you've compiled the dependencies it should be fairly easy to compile the game. If you are not
intending on doing any serious development you can simply compile ocMain.cpp.

If you are wanting to do more serious development you will need to run build/oc_build/bin/oc_build.bat
as a pre-build step. This tool is mainly responsible for code generation.
